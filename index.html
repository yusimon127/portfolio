    <h2>My Story</h2>
    <p>
      Over the past 2 years, I have discovered my passion for computer programming. When I was admitted to UCLA 4 years ago, I had no idea what I loved to do. My parents always encouraged me to become a doctor. However, that was not my area of interest. When I took my first programming class, the most important thing that I learned was that I loved solving problems. I told myself that there is always a solution to a problem, no matter how long it takes. I have always lived with that motto, which was to never give up. I always worked out the problems in my programming homework and projects with the desire to reach the final product. I always tackled the problems and bugs in my code with my fullest potential. If I cannot find a solution at the moment, I will take a short break and then resume to thinking about the problem again. To maximize learning, I tried to keep hints from my teacher as minimal as possible. I wanted to solve the homework problems on my own. When it came to group projects, I always commented on how each function/method was supposed to be performed. I wanted my group to know how the functions/methods that I created fits into the overall project.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since I recently graduated from UCLA, I want to get my foot in the door to something that I am passionate about. I am looking for an opportunity to challenge my problem solving skills as well as learn more about web development. Recently, I took a web development course. Currently, I am working on my own personal web application projects. It involves learning Python and the Django framework to build a health & fitness tracking web application. I never give up on challenges and I will never let a coding bug go until the program runs the way it was intended to run. It is my goal to have a career in web development and I will always strive for doing something I love.
